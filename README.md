The scripts contained here use RCapture and RMark packages. RCapture installation proceeds like any R package installation, while RMark requires additional installation and configuration of the MARK program.

For instructions to install MARK (non-trivial especially on Mac, 
requires XCode command line tools, Homebrew, comfort using the Terminal), see:
